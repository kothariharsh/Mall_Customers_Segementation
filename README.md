# Mall_Customers_Segementation

In mall it is very important for the management to segregate the customers that are present in the mall so that they can provide certain offers to a particular group and 
that can be used to increase the sales profit of the mall as well as build their reputation. In this repository I have used the mall dataset to segregate the customers.
It is just a basic segementation project that is used to segment the customers in a mall based on their age, salary and spending score.
Used the dataset to practice knowledge related to K-means algorithm.
